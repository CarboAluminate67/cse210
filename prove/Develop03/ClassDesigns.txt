Program Specifications:
        The program is meant to store a given scripture as well as the reference, and slowly overtime hide words so the user can memorize them. 
    Overtime the scripture will slowly dissapear and it will be memorized entirely.
        The user inputs would be first the scripture reference and text to be memorized. Then either the enter key to continue, or 'quit' to 
    end the program.
        The program would output the same scripture reference and text with less and less words each time.
    Whenever the user enters 'quit' or when all the words have been removed.
