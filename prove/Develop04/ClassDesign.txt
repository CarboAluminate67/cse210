Mindfullness program

    The program will run an user through a series of mindfullness activities to reflect. The main user inputs would be in the menu deciding which activity to 
do. After this, the only input would be anything the user lists in the 'listing' activity, and the number of second they want to participate in each activity.
The output would be the menu, messages, and timers/animations that guide the user through each activity. The program ends when the user decides by inputting
'quit' in the menu.
