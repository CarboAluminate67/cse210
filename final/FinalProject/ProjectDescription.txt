Open-ended project description:
    Myself and hundreds of thousands of other 'rocket nerds' are all very familiar with and play a game known as 'Kerbal Space Program'; A spaceflight simulator
that uses realistic(ish) rocket designs made by the player in an effort to explore the in-game solar system. In the game there are dozens of choices of rocket
engines all fitting their own needs and purposes. It can be difficult at times to choose one. As such for a while I have wanted to make a catalogue of engines
that allows me to easily sort and decide on an engine to use in my next rocket design given my needs. 

    In this open-ended final project I will create an OOP 'library' of the engines available in the game, with functions to sort, organize, search, and compare
the engine choices. In the catalogue the user can create engines matching the specs of in-game engines or add their own engines. I will use a Menu class to
navigate and sort the engines, and a base Engine class that covers all engines. Further I can have 3 subclasses: LiquidFuel, SolidFuel, and ColdGas engines. 
Finally the LiquidFuel engines will branch out further to cover OpenCycle, FuelRich, OxRich, FullFlow, and Hypergolic engines. This is a total of 10 classes
with 3 levels of inheritence. Each class will hold private stats unique to its engine type, and I will have an array of various Engine objects that can be
manipulated in the Menu class to sort and search as I please.
