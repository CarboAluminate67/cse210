My excitement and passion for the field of rocketry led me to create this interactive rocket engine catalogue that records real-world rocket engines to store in your own database. As a bonus, you can play a mini-game to memorize random statistics of the engines. Use numbers 1-7 to interact with the menu. Simply answer questions simply and create your own list of engines. Your engines as well as point tracking are stored in any assortment of text files of your choosing.
